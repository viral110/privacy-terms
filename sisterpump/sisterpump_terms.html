    <h1>Terms of Use (EULA) – SisterPump</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last Updated: 11-12-2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to SisterPump (“the App”). By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use (“Terms”). If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

    <p>These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you (“the user”) and SisterPump, operated by sistersoundfr.</p>

    <h2>1. Eligibility &amp; Use of the App</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 18 years old to use SisterPump. You agree to use the App only for personal, non-commercial purposes and in compliance with applicable laws. SisterPump is designed only as a breastfeeding and pumping tracking tool and should not be used as a substitute for professional healthcare.</p>

    <h2>2. Health &amp; Wellness Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>SisterPump provides general wellness tracking, including breastfeeding timers, pumping logs, and milk storage records. The App does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. It should not replace professional medical consultation or be used for clinical purposes.</p>
    <p>Always consult a doctor, pediatrician, lactation consultant, or qualified healthcare provider for any concerns related to breastfeeding, milk supply, infant feeding, or health. If you experience a medical emergency, contact your local emergency services immediately.</p>

    <h2>3. Subscriptions &amp; Payments</h2>
    <p>Certain features require a paid auto-renewable subscription (“SisterPump Premium”). Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase. The subscription automatically renews unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period. Renewal charges will occur within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.</p>
    <p>You can manage or cancel your subscription anytime in your App Store Account Settings. Refunds are handled directly by Apple, not SisterPump. Subscription prices may vary by region.</p>

    <h2>4. User Content &amp; Data</h2>
    <p>You may enter personal data such as breastfeeding logs, pumping activity, milk storage records, and notes. You retain full ownership of all data you enter. You grant SisterPump a limited license to store and process this data only for the purpose of operating the App. Your data is securely stored using Firebase and is not sold, shared, or misused.</p>

    <h2>5. Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your use of the App is governed by our Privacy Policy, which explains how your information is collected and protected. By using SisterPump, you agree to the Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>7. Prohibited Conduct</h2>

    <h2>8. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the App if you violate these Terms or misuse the App. You may stop using the App at any time by deleting it from your device.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes are made means you accept the updated Terms.</p>
